# About

Musique.js is a JavaScript library created by [Nicolas de Garrigues](https://github.com/lainocs),  [Julien Cousin-Alliot](https://github.com/Nispeon) and [Tom Louveau](https://github.com/bakabruh).

Started in 2023 for a school project, we decided to continue the development of this library to make it more complete and more accessible.

This project is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/musiqueJS/musiqueJS)

Do not hesitate to contribute to the project by creating a pull request or by creating an issue.

Love and music ‚ù§Ô∏è
