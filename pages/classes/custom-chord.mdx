# Custom Chord

## What is a custom chord?

A custom chord is a chord that is not part of the standard chord library.

## How to create a custom chord?

A custom chord can be created with the following code:

```javascript filename="index.js" {3-8} copy
import { CustomChord, Note, NoteEnum } from 'musiquejs';

const customChord = new CustomChord([
  new Note(NoteEnum['C'], 4, 0.18),
  new Note(NoteEnum['E'], 4, 0.18),
  new Note(NoteEnum['G'], 4, 0.36),
  new Note(NoteEnum['B'], 4, 0.54),
])

```

The above code will create a custom chord with the following notes:

- C4 with a duration of 0.18 seconds

- G4 with a duration of 0.36 seconds
- B4 with a duration of 0.54 seconds

const customChord = new CustomChord([

  new Note(NoteEnum['E'], 4, 0.18),
  new Note(NoteEnum['G'], 4, 0.36),
