# Chords

## What is a Chord?

A chord is a group of [notes](/classes/note) that are played together.

## Types of Chords

This library implements two classes for chords:
- [CustomChord](/classes/chord#customchord)
- [Chord](/classes/chord#chord)

## CustomChord

What we call "CustomChord" is a class that allows you to create your own chords by specifying the notes you want to include in it.

## How to create a custom chord?

```javascript filename="index.js" {3-7} copy
import { CustomChord, Note } from 'musiquejs';

const cchord = new CustomChord([
    new Note('G', 5, 0.18),
    new Note('C', 5, 0.18),
    new Note('E', 5, 0.18)
  ]);
```

CustomChords can then simply be inserted into a [partition](/classes/partition) easily like [notes](/classes/note) or played directly.

## How to play a custom chord?

```javascript filename="index.js" {8} copy
import { CustomChord, Note } from 'musiquejs';

const cchord = new CustomChord([
    new Note('C', 5, 0.18),
    new Note('E', 5, 0.18)
]);

cchord.play();
```

  Chords have yet to be added to the library as of version 1.1.0.
  This feature will be added in a future release, it could change from what is currently displayed here.
</Callout>

What we call "Chord" is a class that represents an existing real-life chord tha is often present in music pieces.

## Existing chords

| Chord   |  Notes   |
|:--------|:--------:|
| A major | A, C#, E |
| C major | C, E, G  |
| D major | D, F#, A |

A chord can be called with the following code:

```javascript filename="index.js" {3} copy
import { Chord } from 'musiquejs';

const chord = new Chord('C Major');
```

Chords can then simply be inserted into a [partition](/classes/partition) or played directly.

## How to play a chord?

```javascript filename="index.js" {5} copy
import { Chord } from 'musiquejs';

const chord = new Chord('C Major');

chord.play();
```
