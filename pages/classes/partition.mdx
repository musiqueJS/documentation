# Partition

## What is a partition?

A partition is a collection of notes. It is the most basic element of music.

## How to create a partition?

A partition can be created in two ways.

### Partition Class

You can create a partition by using the Partition class and passing an array of notes or chords, the oscillator type and the audio context.

```javascript filename="index.js" {3-12} copy
import { Partition, Note, Chord } from 'musiquejs';

const partition = new Partition(
  [
    new Note('D', 4, 0.18),
    new Note('D', 4, 0.18),
    new Note('D', 5, 0.36),
    new Chord([new Note('A', 4, 0.54), new Note('C', 5, 0.54)])
  ],
  'sine',
  audioContext
);
```

### JSONPartition Class
You can also create a partition by using the JSONPartition class and passing a JSON object.
```json
// partition.json
[
    {
      "note": "D",
      "octave": 4,
      "duration": 0.18
    },
    {
      "note": "D",
      "octave": 4,
      "duration": 0.18
    },
    {
      "note": "D",
      "octave": 5,
      "duration": 0.36
    },
    [
      {
        "note": "A",
        "octave": 4,
        "duration": 0.54
      },
      {
        "note": "C",
        "octave": 5,
        "duration": 0.54
      }
    ]
]
```

```javascript filename="index.js" {5-12} copy
import { JSONPartition } from 'musiquejs';

const json = require('./partition.json');

const partition = new JSONPartition(
  json,
  'sine',
  audioContext
);
```
Importing a JSON might seem longer, but it is useful when you want to create a partition from a file or share your creations!

No matter which way you choose, this will create a partition with the following notes:

- D4 with a duration of 0.18 seconds
- D4 with a duration of 0.18 seconds
- D5 with a duration of 0.36 seconds
- A chord containing A4 with a duration of 0.54 seconds and C5 with a duration of 0.54 seconds

You can choose the OscillatorType of the partition. The default value is `'sine'`.

List of OscillatorType:
    - sine
    - square
    - sawtooth
    - triangle

You can also choose the AudioContext of the partition.
By default, you can use `window.AudioContext`.

## How to play a partition?

A partition can be played with the following code:

```javascript filename="index.js" {14} copy
import { Partition, Note } from 'musiquejs';

const partition = new Partition(
[
  new Note('D', 4, 0.18),
  new Note('D', 4, 0.18),
  new Note('D', 5, 0.36),
  new Note('A', 4, 0.54),
],
'sine',
audioContext
);

partition.play();

```
