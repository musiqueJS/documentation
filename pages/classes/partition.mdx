## What is a partition?

A partition is a collection of notes. It is the most basic element of music.

## How to create a partition?

A partition can be created with the following code:

```javascript filename="index.js" {3-12} copy
import { Partition, Note, NoteEnum } from 'musiquejs';

const partition = new Partition(
[
  new Note(NoteEnum['D'], 4, 0.18),
  new Note(NoteEnum['D'], 4, 0.18),
  new Note(NoteEnum['D'], 5, 0.36),
  new Note(NoteEnum['A'], 4, 0.54),
],
'square',
audioContext
);

```

The above code will create a partition with the following notes:

- D4 with a duration of 0.18 seconds
- D4 with a duration of 0.18 seconds
